    <h2>Coding Tutorials!</h2>
    <p>
        The first thing you need to know is how to establish variables<br />
        Variables are a way the computer stores information. Which can be stored in many different ways, but we will only focus on a few:<br />
        Integers, which are basic number without decimals, and Strings, which are words and letters<br />
        To define a variable, you need to use the code 'Dim' as such<br />
        'Dim N as Integer' <br />
        With 'N' being the name of the object the computer will remember
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
        The next thing to know if how to make decisions. <br />
        To make decisions, you will need either an If/Then statement, or a Select Case Statement.<br />
        An If/Then Statement is used to describe how If a specific option is inputted, then the computer will provide a specific output, as such<br />
        If N = 15 Then
        N = 15
        end If<br />
        Another way to make decisions is with a Select Case Statement, which defines multiple different inputs creating multiple different outputs<br />
        The way that a Select Case is different is that an If/Then Statement has limited options to specific inputs, but a Select Case Statement can have as many inputs and outputs as you can type! As such:<br />
        Select Case
        Case N = 15
        N = 15
        Case N = 17
        N = 17
        ...
        Case N = 100
        N = 100
        end Select
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
        Another interesting coding statement are Loops<br />
        In Loops, you can repeat numbers, or phrases multiple times over, or have the computer do some simple math for you. As Such:
        For N as Integer = 1 to 57 step 4
        Console.Write(index.ToString & " ")
        Next
        Console.WriteLine("")
        <br />
        This will output the numbers 1 through 57, but only by adding 4 each time.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
        The last important piece of information needed are inputs and outputs<br />
        Inputs are what the user of your program decide based on the options that you provide, and can be read as such<br />
        N = Console.ReadLine()
        <br />
        This will make the computer read what the user input and define the variable as that input<br />
        An output is what the computer tells the user, either based on what the user chose as an input, or programmed whenever the programmer decides. As such:<br />
        Console.WriteLine("This is the Output")
        <br />
        This will read out to the user 'This is the Output'
    </p>
