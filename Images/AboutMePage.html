    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <h3>My name is Dylan Stewart. I am sixteen years old and a junior in high school. I started learning programming this year and have enjoyed every class this semester.<br /> Some other topics in school that interest me are: Finance, Music, and Environmental Science. In my free time I enjoy watching TV and playing video games, <br />but some of my time off school is taken up by work. Thank you for listening and please check out some of the other pages below!</h3>
